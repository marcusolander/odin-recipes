Part of the TOP course - creating a recipe page

This part of the course aims to utilize the skills we've learned in its first segment, specifically focusing on simple HTML commands.

The objective is to create a rather minimalist webpage describing three different recipes, with each recipe having its own dedicated page.

Enjoy!
