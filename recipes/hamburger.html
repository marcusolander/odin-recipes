    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>I’m going to make a bold statement: this is simply the best burger you will ever make or eat at home. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef - I used 85% lean </li>
        <li>Burger Buns - toasted </li>
        <li>Pickles - thinly sliced </li>
        <li>American Cheese </li>
        <li>Special Sauce - combine ketchup, yellow mustard and mayonaise </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your burger bun by laying toppings on the bottom bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Position your Baking Steel or Baking Steel Griddle on the stovetop or grill. Preheat on high heat for 10-15 minutes, looking for a surface temperature of 400-425 degrees F. To test the surface, sprinkle a few drops of water on top of the surface; they should “dance” rapidly across the hot surface, evaporating in moments.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the balls of beef on the griddle and use a stiff metal spatula to smash them down into the griddle, using a second spatula to add targeted pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than the burger bun. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until well browned and top is beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a metal spatula, carefully scrape the burger patties from the surface, making sure to get all the tasty browned bits. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over one patty and stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from griddle and transfer to waiting burger and bun. Serve immediately.  </li>
    </ol>
